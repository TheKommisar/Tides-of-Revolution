#ideas
CHI_shared_economy:0 "Ancient Economy"
CHI_shared_economy_desc:0 "China has a woefully poor economy, this has been a factor of life in Chinese society apparent to just about everyone since the Europeans and Japanese put on full display their economic prowess. Urbanization, much less any meaningful industrial base, is extraordinarily hard to come by, farming methods are outdated and agriculture has remained unreformed and modern technological advances are nearly completely absent."
CHI_reforming_economy:0 "Reforming Economy"
CHI_reforming_economy_desc:0 "Before 1932, the Republic’s Economy was in absolute shambles: Urbanization was nonexistent, and our already pathetic industrial base had been pretty much all but destroyed in the wars that were fought; the same wars that eventually pushed us into the pitiful state we now find ourselves in. Our agricultural methods were also outdated, and because of the lack of education and rampant illiteracy, technological advances are basically completely absent as well. However, with the help of German advisors, we have started to gradually improve our Economy. With the Germans buying our raw materials and helping us build important infrastructure; such as railroads, we now have a positive net income where we can spend on improving the lives of our citizens. We still have a long way to go if we really want to call ourselves a modernized nation, but with the advancements we have had in these four short years, we are off to a pretty good start."
CHI_white_sun_over_china:0 "The White Sun Over China"
CHI_white_sun_over_china_desc:0 "Since 1911, we have had one mission: To unite China under one banner, governed under the Three Principles of the People, and reform our homeland into a strong, modern, and wealthy nation. Although our vision is grand, and would certainly bring long lasting peace and prosperity to the Chinese people, ever since we started this mission, we have had some serious setbacks. Since 1911, the territories that the Republic controlled had only become smaller and smaller, with various warlords; people who we thought were our allies, backstabbing us, claiming that our Republic is illegitimate and They are the ‘Real China’, while constantly thwarting our noble mission. The treacherous Mongolians and Tibetans have no respect for the Republic; even though we have tried to uphold our friendship with them, they have left us in the dark. Even our former masters, the Manchus, have consolidated their own territories in Manchuria, unwilling to cooperate with us. Ideological fanatics also plague our nation, with radicals constantly looking for revolutionary change’, as if that would create the harmonious society we wish to create, where all races could peacefully live under one union. To make matters worse, foreign powers are also trying to feast on our dying body; Outer Mongolia had fallen under a rogue Russian general and Manchuria almost fell under Japanese control. Even with all the seemingly impossible hardships we have to conquer, what our enemies do not know is that they have underestimated us. Blood, sweat, and tears is  what brings us life, and pain only makes us stronger. One day; doesn’t matter how far in the future that is, doesn’t matter how much suffering it would bring, but one day, we shall have our redemption. Be diligent, Brothers! We shall fight for our final victory: Reclaiming the Mandate of Heaven!"
CHI_failing_republic:0 "The Failing Republic"
CHI_failing_republic_desc:0 "After the disastrous Second Northern Expedition, also known as the Central Plains War, that was conducted in 1930, the Republic’s flaws have been greatly exposed and its scars reopened. Our previous warlord allies have abandoned us, either banding with one another or seeking hostile foreign allies in their hopes of reconquering China under their rule. Our citizens are weary of the constant war, and ideological extremists are trying to fool the naive townsmen to join their cause, using lies of a better and more prosperous future to deceive them. If the government in Nanjing do not pull themselves together, our Republic would not last much longer, and our mission would end in failure."
CHI_sino_german_economy:0 "Sino-German Economy"
CHI_sino_german_economy_desc:0 "Germany is undoubtedly our biggest trading partner and honestly our only close ally. They are kind enough to put in all the effort to try to pull our disjointed Republic together, and even though we know that they are technically doing this for their own gain, we are still eternally grateful. With their help, the trains are finally running again, the factories finally allowed to reopen, and our citizens need not to suffer from starvation. However, skeptics claim that this is a further sign of weakness in the KMT government, having to rely on a foreign nation to do what a normally functional government should be able to do easily. Although that is an absolutely ridiculous claim, people are still entitled to what they believe in, and the government shall not infringe on that principal."
CHI_von_falkenhausens_doctrine:0 "Von Falkenhausen’s Doctrine"
CHI_von_falkenhausens_doctrine_desc:0 "One of our German Advisors, General Alexander von Falkenhausen, had been put in charge to help us develop a cohesive doctrine against our enemies for us to follow, as well as military training and weapon modernization. The General had finalized his product in November of 1935, he stated that China could not fight against any foriegn power head on due to our lack of industrialization and manufacturing capabilities. However, what we do have is a large pool of manpower and vast amounts of land. Therefore, we should attempt to conduct a War of Attrition and Guerilla Warfare behind our enemies’ lines. With our pre-built fortifications, we need to force our enemies to attack as and take as much of their soldiers’ lives as possible before we retreat. After the front had stabilized, our elite divisions, modeled after the German Stoßtruppen, would frequently conduct swift infiltration tactics in order to disorganize our enemies, while the rest of our army would slowly push our enemies back. This tactic is made to suit both the current economic situation and military capabilities of the Republic and also to demoralize our enemies as much as possible due to the massive casualties and our guerilla groups constantly harassing them behind the lines; whether that be attacking their supply convoys or assassination attempts on military officials. Whether or not this doctrine would work remains to be seen, however, we have no reason to not to trust our German allies, whose wisdom from the Great War is more valuable than anything they can give us. Combined with all the experience we gained from fighting our Civil War, von Falkenhausen should’ve created our ultimate guide to victory."
CHI_warring_political_factions:0 "Warring Political Factions"
CHI_warring_political_factions_desc:0 "One of the consequences the Republic had to face after the failure that was the Second Northern Expedition was the political division that has resurfaced in the Nanjing Government. There are five main political factions: The Reformists, Federalists, Conservatives, Nationalists, and Socialists. Each has their own unique view on which way the Republic should progress in order for it to succeed, and none are really keen on compromising with other factions. Although Chiang was still able to push through a few reforms, most of the time there was barely any consensus, and Chiang had to push them through using his near dictatorial powers. In order to form an actual function Republic, one side must be chosen to guide us. If the factional struggles continue inside our government, we would, without a doubt, fail our people and get washed away in the flow of History."
