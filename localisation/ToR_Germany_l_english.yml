GER_social_conservative_party_long:0 "Deutsche Zentrumspartei \n§gThe German Centre Party was founded in 1870. They were mainly a Catholic party which opposed Bismarck’s Kulturkampf policies and because of this they grew to become one of the largest parties in the Empire, often being vital in forming governments. After the Great War they became the second largest party in the Reichstag. After the Putsch they were sidelined by the DNVP, but still retains one of the largest and most consistent bases in the Empire.§!"
GER_paternal_autocrat_party:0 "DNVP"
GER_paternal_autocrat_party_long:0 "Deutschnationale Volkspartei \n§gThe German National People’s Party was founded by the journalist Wolfgang Kapp in 1922. The party incorporated many of the members of the old German Fatherland Party, which had dissolved during the Spartakus uprising, and is very popular among veterans, revanchists and nationalists. In 1923 Kapp alongside many allies within the Prussian elite and the Reichswehr led a coup against the government of Friedrich Ebert. Kapp was appointed Reichskanzler by the Kaiser but would fall ill and die soon after assuming his position. His co-conspirator General Walther von Lüttwitz was appointed chancellor after his death and has since then ruled the German Empire with an iron fist, making use of the paramilitary Stahlhelm and the Freikorps.§!"
GER_authoritarian_democrat_party:0 "DKP"
GER_authoritarian_democrat_party_long:0 "Deutschkonservative Partei \n§gThe German Conservative Party was founded in 1876 and largely represented wealthy landowners, aristocrats and later industrialists. The party enjoyed large support under Bismarck, but started a decline thereafter. Their base largely moved to the DNVP and the party is now merely a more local party representing Prussians in the Empire.§!"
GER_social_democrat_party:0 "SPD"
GER_social_democrat_party_long:0 "Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands \n§gThe Social Democratic Party of Germany is the oldest party in the Reichstag, founded in 1863. They espoused socialism through reform and were highly popular among workers. In 1917 the radical socialists in the party were expelled and formed their own organization, the USPD. With increased support from moderates the party managed to win the general election following the war. After being forced from power during the Kapp-Lüttwitz Putsch the party was criminalized under the reinstated Anti-Socialist Laws. The government accused the party of fraternizing with revolutionaries from Russia and France. However their ban was rescinded in 1931 and the party has since then enjoyed moderate support among the German populace.§!"
GER_social_liberal_party:0 "FVP"
GER_social_liberal_party_long:0 "Fortschrittliche Volkspartei"
GER_classic_liberal_party:0 "NLP"
GER_classic_liberal_party_long:0 "Nationalliberale Partei \n§gThe National Liberal Party was formed in 1867 in support of then Chancellor Bismarck’s foreign policy. Their support of German unification, the Kulturkampf and the Anti-Socialist Laws made them chief allies of Bismarck during his time as Chancellor. The party highly supported the interests of Protestants, nationalists and the burghers and industrialists. After Bismarck abandoned free trade they broke from each other, ending the National Liberal dominance of the Reichstag. During the Great War the party were staunch supporters of the war effort and of territorial expansion, including support for the Pan-German League which would eventually become the German Empire Party. After their defeat the party lost much of its credibility. Leaders like Gustav Stresemann left to join the Progressives while many of their right-wing members joined the DNVP. Since then the party has been struggling with only minor support from big business and industrialists.§!"
