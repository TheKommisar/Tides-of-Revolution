#Descriptions
POLITICS_MOHAMMED_ALIM_DESC:0 "The Emir of Bukhara and the Khan of Khiva and of Kokand, Khoja Skobelev, Ashgabat and Samarakand, and the Transcaspian, Defender of the Faithful, all of these things are accurate titles for Mohammed Alim Khan. Born 3 January 1880, the future Emir was born into the Russian grip, the Russian Empire having held protectorate over the Emirate of Bukhara since 1873, and it is this birth to serve that seemed to follow him the rest of his life. The young Crown Prince would be educated fr 3 years in Saint Petersburg on a variety of subjects with a focus on modern governing and military tactics, which would prove necissary in the coming years. In 1896 he would begin his governership of the Nasef region for the next Twelve Years, before in 1908 being transfered to governing the region of Karmana fo Two years before his father would pass away in late 1910, following his death the New Emir of Bukhara would formally take over on January 3rd 1911. The young Emir initially showed promise for reform minded elements, however as time wne ton he simply lapsed into the norm of the rulers of the Emirate, simply toying with reform as a way to keep the disgrunteled Clergy in line and continuing to turn a blind eye to corruption or taxes on their own authority. The Emir, who had been confined to a rather mundane life of ruling his rather small realm for several years at this point, would have a window of escape with the beggining of the Russian Civil War he had his chance. It seemed fortune favored the Emir, his alliance with the White Army against the Reds proved to come to fruition, however he was only able to even stand a fighting chance in the conflct due to one group; the Basmachi. The Basmachi, a broad coalition stretching from Traditional Muslims to the Radical Reformist Jadids and even Pan Turkic elements, all with one goal in common; Driving out the Russians, would come to dominate the Emirate in every way possible, they dominated the government, military and effectively took control over the economy. the Basmachi would receive a signifigant boost when Enver Pasha would join their ranks and as the Russian Civil War died down and the frontier with the Russians was secured, the Basmachi mopped up regionalist sentiment and revolts, with Enver Pasha and his clique of Pan Turkic Reformists coming out on top and the Traditionalists of Ibrahim Bek being forced from power, the Basmachi would put the Emir on high and at the all time low. On one hand his control now extended far beyond Bukhara, adopting th vacant titles of the Khans of Khiva and Kokand for himself and adopting many other territories of Turkic muslims into the fold of his new nation, but on the other hand he had become nothing but a mere figurehead and rubber stamp for Enver Pasha and his military clique who have run the Nation ever since 1922, directing the nations policies, both domestic and foreign, to the wishes of the military."
