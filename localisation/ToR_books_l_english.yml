alt_history.1.d:0 "British novelist and playwright Ernest Raymond has today released his new novel, titled “Kaiserreich - Legacy of the Weltkrieg”. The book, under a new genre called ‘alternative-history’ arrived in bookstores across the empire, to critical acclaim.\n\nBased on the premise “What if Germany won WW1?”, the novel follows the view of several characters, in a world much different to our own. In this book, the Central Powers, against all odds, manage to successfully defeat the Entente, and keep the United States out of the war as well. Much of the war follows our world’s timeline until 1918, where a large-scale Entente offensive designated to break the German lines fails, sapping the British and French of much manpower. This, combined with the fall of Greece and the sudden opening of the British blockade, caused British forces to evacuate from mainland Europe, with Paris falling soon after. After a general strike, mainland France fell to syndicalism; the Kaiserreich timeline’s equivalent of communism. The remains of the French establishment flee to Algiers, setting up a government-in-exile. Italy falls to much the same fate, splitting up into several states after a civil war. As Germany was desperate to see the Bolshevik threat put down, they intervened to ensure a White victory in the civil war.\n\nIn 1925, a British general strike over coal tariffs escalated into a large-scale revolution after the government massacred strikers. The United Kingdom falls to the same fate of its Entente neighbours as the Union of Britain is declared, and the royalist government flees to Canada. In the process, the Raj collapses and all British territories are either seized or declare independence. Austria begins the process of federalising its empire, and the Germans are left with an abundance of new colonial territories. The United States, neutral throughout the entire affair, descended into severe political divide in the aftermath of the Great Depression, and by 1937 fell into a 4-way civil war. Wars also take place against Great War victors Bulgaria and the Ottoman empire, over lost territory.\n\nThe novel ends with a war between the Internationale, comprising France, Britain and other syndicalist nations, against the German led Reichspakt over Alsace-Lorraine. The exiled Entente also jump in on the action and attempt to retake France and the British isles, causing massive loss of life. While the novel has been lauded for being well-researched and historically accurate, critics have accused it of being pro-socialist or supportive of France, with accusations regarding Raymond himself holding French citizenship, something which he vehemently denies. Nonetheless, it has sold well, and citizens are eagerly waiting for his sequel, which he has nicknamed Fuhrerreich."
