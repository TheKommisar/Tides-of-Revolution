tornews.1.t:0 "Second Emu War"
tornews.1.d:0 "Reports from Australia indicate that the government could be looking to start another war with their national bird; the emu. This comes after a steep rise of recorded emu incidents in the Australian country in the past months, much higher than the prior conflict four years ago. For farmers, it has gotten to a point where they no longer have been able to rely on their own crops, instead living off of foreign imports and government bailouts to remain. Although even then, many have already given up their farms and moved to the cities, leaving behind hundreds of abandoned stations and small towns. In Parliament today, Representatives were debating on whether or not they should intervene on the farmers’ behalf, but considering how badly they lost the last war, chances are slim. Sooner or later though, we could see the beginning of a Second Emu War."

tornews.4.t:0 "The Second Baltic War"
tornews.4.d:0 "Early reports from along the Dvina river had indicated the start of full on conflict between the Duchy of Courland and the Republic of Latvia for some time, however it is only several days after the conflict began that official international statements on the situation of war have been made. The Baltic is once again embroiled in conflict as the Baltic Germans and the Russians within Courland have already declared their intent to pacify the Republic of Latvia in a full invasion, who it claims has been actively supporting partisan groups in violation of the 1920 treaty of Salaspils, Latvia has likewise declared their intent to smash the grip of Foreign powers over Latvia once and for all by destroying the small Duchy for it's 'crimes against the Latvian people'.In light of this news the Republic of Estonia has declared it's official support for Latvia, though it is not yet apparent if the Estonians will directly intervene in the conflict. It seems only a matter of time now until one side has breached the river that divides them and begins the advance to crush the other, though who shall accomplish this remains to be seen as the war in it's infancy has just begun."
