tornews.1.t:0 "Second Emu War"
tornews.1.d:0 "Reports from Australia indicate that the government could be looking to start another war with their national bird; the emu. This comes after a steep rise of recorded emu incidents in the Australian country in the past months, much higher than the prior conflict four years ago. For farmers, it has gotten to a point where they no longer have been able to rely on their own crops, instead living off of foreign imports and government bailouts to remain. Although even then, many have already given up their farms and moved to the cities, leaving behind hundreds of abandoned stations and small towns. In Parliament today, Representatives were debating on whether or not they should intervene on the farmers’ behalf, but considering how badly they lost the last war, chances are slim. Sooner or later though, we could see the beginning of a Second Emu War."

tornews.2.d:0 "The British Empire today has entered a state of mourning, following the death of King George V, who died at his home, Sandringham House, age 70. One of Britain's most beloved monarchs, King George's reign oversaw British efforts in the Great War and the Russian Civil War, as well as the decentralisation of the British Empire and the rise of radicalism across the globe.\n\nConsidered one of the last monarchs of the old-school, the throne will now be given to King George's eldest son, Prince Edward, who will assume the title of King under the regal name Edward VIII."

tornews.4.t:0 "The Second Baltic War"
tornews.4.d:0 "Early reports from along the Dvina river had indicated the start of full on conflict between the Duchy of Courland and the Republic of Latvia for some time, however it is only several days after the conflict began that official international statements on the situation of war have been made. The Baltic is once again embroiled in conflict as the Baltic Germans and the Russians within Courland have already declared their intent to pacify the Republic of Latvia in a full invasion, who it claims has been actively supporting partisan groups in violation of the 1920 treaty of Salaspils, Latvia has likewise declared their intent to smash the grip of Foreign powers over Latvia once and for all by destroying the small Duchy for it's 'crimes against the Latvian people'. It seems only a matter of time now until one side breaches the river that divides them, though who shall accomplish this remains to be seen."
