tornews.1.t:0 "Second Emu War"
tornews.1.d:0 "Reports from Australia indicate that the government could be looking to start another war with their national bird; the emu. This comes after a steep rise of recorded emu incidents in the Australian country in the past months, much higher than the prior conflict four years ago. For farmers, it has gotten to a point where they no longer have been able to rely on their own crops, instead living off of foreign imports and government bailouts to remain. Although even then, many have already given up their farms and moved to the cities, leaving behind hundreds of abandoned stations and small towns. In Parliament today, Representatives were debating on whether or not they should intervene on the farmers’ behalf, but considering how badly they lost the last war, chances are slim. Sooner or later though, we could see the beginning of a Second Emu War."
