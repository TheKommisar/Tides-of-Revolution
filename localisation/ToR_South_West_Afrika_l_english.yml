#Ideas
NMB_colony:0 "Colonial Administration"
NMB_colony_desc:0 "Our administration is a colonial territory of the German Fatherland, as such we are extremely limited on men from both the native population and from Germany proper who are willing to serve under our banner, as well as the extreme instability that comes with the ruling of the local populace and their refusal to collaberate."
NMB_germanization:0 "Germanization"
NMB_germanization_desc:0 "South West Africa has been an imperial German colony since 1884, and in the period of 50 years that have passed since it was first founded many ethnic Germans have immigrated to the colony, seeking to escape poverty or any measure of crisis at home. Following the great war and the German economic decline, combined with the turbulant social situation in the fatherland, many saw South West Africa as a land free of the strife of home and fled, increasing the number of the German minority to nearly 100 thousand men by 1936. This increase in numbers has been greatly beneficial to the colony, as many skilled labourers along with the general increase in loyal subjects has greatly boosted the colonies prosperity."  
NMB_schutztruppe:0 "The Schutztruppe"
NMB_schutztruppe_desc:0 "The Schutztruppe, or Protection Force, is the African Colonial Army of the German Empire. The force of both native Africans and European settlers and volunteers has become known for it's professional ethos, garnering a reputation as a highly skilled force from it's numerous colonial exploits. The Schutztruppe are the pride of the German colonies, providing both a practical ared force that has been under constant improvement following the great war and a large morale boost to the populace they protect."
NMB_afrikaner_exiles:0 "Afrikaner Exiles"
NMB_afrikaner_exiles_desc:0 "During the Great War, many Afrikaners, or Boers, would flee the neighbouring Union of South Africa and defect to German South West Africa, hoping to incite the German colony to attack the British, many following even after the War was over. While their efforts failed numerous exiles have stayed in South West Africa, long having been charged with treason by the South African government, the most notable of these exiles is Manie Maritz, who continue to pressure the Afrikaner Exile community and the German populace into a war with South Africa and Britain."

southwestafricaincident.2.t:0 "Boer Defectors Cross the Border"
southwestafricaincident.2.d:0 "We have recieved reports of and confirmed that numerous Afrikaner men, bearing South African weapons and uniforms, have crossed our borders. Despite initially thinking this was an invasion force the answer is now more clear, the men are defectors from the Union of South Africa seeking asylum, bringing weapons with them as a form of tribute. These forms of defection by Afrikaners are not uncommon, they have happened quite frequently ever since the end of the great war. These men come bearing the ideological support for local rule in the colony, not dissimilar to the chief Afrikaner exile leader Salomon Gerhardus Maritz, along with wishing to enlist in the Schutztruppe and turning over their cache of weapons to the authorities."    
southwestafricaincident.2.a:0 "Willkommen, Kameraden!"  
southwestafricaincident.4.t:0 "Trouble on the Border"
southwestafricaincident.4.d:0 "It appears numerous Afrikaner defectors, initally thought to have been an invading force, have crossed the South African border into our territory with intent to join the Schutztruppe. However they are not alone, our intel reveals a contingent of the South African Army has trailed them into our territory and intends to attack and most likely capture the defectors. While the most obvious course of action is to help the defectors drive the South Africans from our land,, many in our administartion excercise caution, fearing defeat on the battlefield or even worse all out war."
southwestafricaincident.4.a:0 "Send South Africa a Warning"
southwestafricaincident.4.b:0 "A Few Boers Aren't Worth the Blood"
southwestafricaincident.6.t:0 "The South Africans Refuse"
southwestafricaincident.6.d:0 "The South African Government has refused our demands to withdrawl from South West Africa, thus we are now in a dangerous situation. The governor is uncertain about the course of action to take, many in the administration have simply wished to let the South Africans capture the defectors, their argument being risking defeat on the field or all out war is not worth a few Afrikaner Deserters. The Afrikaner Exile Commuity and the German Population at large however are in a rage, demanding the Schutztruppe expel the South Africans by entering the Demilitarized Zone at once, with Salomon Gerhardus Maritz, the infamous Afrikaner Exile, even calling upon Afrikaner and German Namibian militias to be formed to fight themselves. Th situation is tense, we could enter the DMZ to drive the South Africans out or we could simply let them have what they want."
southwestafricaincident.6.a:0 "Drive the British Lapdogs Out!"
southwestafricaincident.6.b:0 "Make No Attempts to Oppose the South Africans"
southwestafricaincident.10.t:0 "Victory Against South Africa!"
southwestafricaincident.10.d:0 "During the recent border raid by South African forces attempting to chase down and capture the Afrikaner defectors who crossed our borders, our Schutztruppe decisively came out on top! The stunning defeat of the much larger Union of South Africa without the help of the German Fatherland has created waves of celebration across the country, the German Namibians and Afrikaner community are enthusiastically embracing this victory, leading to a rise in support for the idea of Self-Government. Meanwhile the Afrikaner defectors who started the incident have been warmly recieved and their generous donations of weapons accepted with open arms."
southwestafricaincident.10.a:0 "We Germans Have Stood Our Ground!"
southwestafricaincident.11.t:0 "The South Africans Victorious"
southwestafricaincident.11.d:0 "The Schutztruppe have returned to Windhoek bruised and battered, having suffered defeat in the border conflict against South Africa. The Defectors who initiated the conflict have been captured and taken Cross border by the South African military, this utter failure on the Battlefield has led to a decrease in self confidence by the people, and a decrease in confidence for the Colonial Administrations ability to protect them. This massive blunder has cost us dearly and we are feeling the burn of the fire of War now, it seems the people are losing confidence in oour administration and the Afrikaner Exile community is stark raving mad about our failures."
southwestafricaincident.11.a:0 "A Stain on Our Administration"
southwestafricaincident.12.t:0 "The South Africans Withdraw"
southwestafricaincident.12.d:0 "The South Africans have cowardly withdrawn from our land, seeing our superior strength of arms they have trembeled and given into our demands. This superior show of control over our borders has led to a rise in support for Home Rule in SOuth West Africa, as Afrikaners and German Namibians alike pour out to show a sense of pride in their homeland. As well as our triumph over South Africa we have also safely transported the Afrikaner defectors, incredibly pleased by the willingness of the Government to defend them, and their weapons to the North of the country, where they have been enlisted in the Schutztruppe."
southwestafricaincident.12.a:0 "Watch the Cowards Flee!"

#Descriptions

POLITICS_LUDWIG_VON_ESTORFF_DESC:0 "Ludwig von Estorff, born 25th of December 1859 in the city of Hannover, has often been called the Ox of South West Africa, ever struggling on for his country. The 77 Year Old Man has had quite a career. He has fought numerous campaigns in Africa in his period of service, from being stationed in East Africa in 1900, to fighting the Herero uprising in 1911 and becoming commander of the South West African Schutztruppe, to fighting the British and South Africans in open battle during the Great War in 1914. During the Great War and following the collapse of the Schutztruppe as a frontline fighting force in South West Africa, being cut off from home, Ludwig von Estorff would conduct a minor guerilla campaign in Namibia despite initial doubts about the potential of such a campaign from von Estorff himself. Despite all these grievances the old Prussian man had found South West Africa to his liking, and following the end of the war he would continue to stay in the colony as Commander despite his old Age. It was this dedication both to Germany and his extensive experience in South West Africa that led to him being promoted to Colonial Governor of South West Africa by the Kaiser in 1928. As governor he has maintained a rather stern and status quo approach, but is generally hands off when it comes to the German Namibian settler population, resulting in South West Africa experiencing a population boom of white settlers escaping the social, class and economic issues of the German Fatherland. By the year 1936 Ludwig von Estorff is an old man, weary and his health starting to fail him, it is obvious to everyone in the colony he will soon be retiring, and even more obvious is the importance of his succesor."
