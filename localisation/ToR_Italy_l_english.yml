#Ideas

ITA_great_depression:0 "Economic Depression"
ITA_memories_of_the_war:0 "Memories of the War"
ITA_memories_of_the_war_desc:0 "In the Great War, one million Italians, both military and civilians, lost their lives in the conflict, with thousands more dying of the diseases which gripped the country in the war's aftermath. In addition to this, Italy received only meagre territorial concessions at the war's end, which led to many Italians questioning whether the sacrifices made in the war was worth it at all. In the years following the devastating conflict, the general mood for another war sunk to an all time low, and the number of men enlisting in the army is falling lower and lower. The generals and admirals, too, have expressed their reluctance in fighting another conflict."
ITA_political_radicalisation:0 "Political Radicalisation"
ITA_political_radicalisation_desc:0 "Following the Great Depression, the relatively stable Italian political theatre soon began to bear witness to the rise of fringe radical parties and radical ideologies. Although the socialist government which controls Italy is still popular with most of the people, more and more are being dragged away from moderate politics, disillusioned by the government's inability to resolve the economic crisis."
ITA_new_constitution:0 "New Constitution"
ITA_new_constitution_desc:0 "The implementation of a new constitution for the Kingdom of Italy was one of the first acts done by the socialist government when they rose to power. The constitution, which mimiced the British political model, is very popular among the Italian people, and serves as a source of stability for the country."
ITA_socialist_hegemony:0 "Socialist Hegemony"
ITA_socialist_hegemony_desc:0 "Ever since the Elections of 1923, the Italian political theatre has been dominated by the same socialist political parties. Although this has given us the ability to pass laws and reforms with relative ease, our citizens are yearning for change."
ITA_victor_emmanuel:0 "Victor Emmanuel III"

#Focuses
#starter 
ITA_aftermath_of_bill_failure:0 "Aftermath of the Relief Bill's Failure"
ITA_aftermath_of_bill_failure_desc:0 "To describe our situation as dire would be a severe understatement. The economy is in shambles, millions are unemployed, and our economic relief bill - a bill members of the government have been constructing for the past several months - has failed to pass. No doubt a severe blow to the government's prestige, it is important to keep our heads high as there is still an opportunity for us to recover."
ITA_dismiss_beneduce:0 "Dismiss Beneduce"
ITA_dismiss_beneduce_desc:0 "Despite having served the government faithfully through the economic turmoil, Minister of the Economy Alberto Beneduce is seen by some observers as too 'socialist' of a government minister than some approve of. He must be replaced with a more compromising, moderate candidate who will be able to see both sides of the issue and understand their complaints."
ITA_calm_the_moderates:0 "Calm the Moderates"
ITA_calm_the_moderates_desc:0 "The moderates will call us any name the people want to hear. Republicans, socialists, communists, French-backed; we are none of these things! In fact, we might be the only viable force standing against them to defend our fragile democracy. The moderates must know that."
ITA_with_the_liberals:0 "Dinner with the Liberals"
ITA_with_the_liberals_desc:0 "The socialists are traitors willing to sell out the country to the French. We haven't many allies, but one of the few willing to work with us are the liberals. God forbid someone else lures them before we do!"
ITA_with_the_liberals_tt:0 "§LWe will now cooperate with the Liberals§!"
ITA_with_the_socialists:0 "Tea with the Socialists"
ITA_with_the_socialists_desc:0 "The Unitary Socialist Party did not have its roots in the late 19th century like many other parties, instead it formed from a split, due to the result of a dispute between various factions of the Italian Socialist Party. Our party is young, and we were once brothers; is there not more in common with them than the liberals?"
ITA_with_the_socialists_tt:0 "§LWe will now cooperate with the Socialists§!"
ITA_regarding_military_spending:0 "Regarding Military Spending"
ITA_regarding_military_spending_desc:0 "Military spending is a controversial subject in Italian politics, and it is about prime time we come to resolve this issue."
ITA_crackdown_on_radical_groups:0 "Crackdown on Radical Groups"
ITA_crackdown_on_radical_groups_desc:0 "Being a liberal democracy, we are tolerant in regards to many things. Yet one thing we are not tolerant about is radicalism. No matter what, these fringe radical groups promoting their dangerous ideologies are a threat to our free democracy, and they shall be dealt with as such. Conservatives may cry, but it is necessary for the ensurance of a free and democratic Italy."
ITA_increased_subsidies_for_farmers:0 "Increased Subsidies for Farmers"
ITA_increased_subsidies_for_farmers_desc:0 "Since the dawn of time, farming has been the most important role in civilisation. Food, as overlooked as it is, is essential to a functioning society. Increasing subsidies for farmers will encourage them to produce more, and thus stave off some of the effects of the Depression."
ITA_establish_food_banks:0 "Establish Food Banks"
ITA_establish_food_banks_desc:0 "What will our country become, if even the average citizen cannot afford food to fill his belly? The National Food Distribution Organisation will be established to ensure no citizen goes hungry, no matter their creed, religion, race or gender."
ITA_prepare_the_bill:0 "Prepare the Bill"
ITA_prepare_the_bill_desc:0 "Drafting has begun on the second bill. This time there are more concessions authored in line with the agenda of the conservatives and moderates."
ITA_a_second_attempt:0 "A Second Attempt"
ITA_a_second_attempt_desc:0 "The clauses are written, the sections are laid out; moment of truth awaits."
ITA_a_second_attempt_tt:0 "§LThe Parliament will once again try to pass the Economic Relief Bill§!"
ITA_sigh_of_relief:0 "A Sigh of Relief"
ITA_sigh_of_relief_desc:0 "With the help of our coalition, we expect a majority of votes to approve the new economic bill. Although having been watered down heavily due to complaints from the opposition, it nonetheless will still bring much needed relief to many Italians and will be the first step to getting us out of the economic crisis."
ITA_as_cool_heads_prevail:0 "As Cool Heads Prevail"
ITA_as_cool_heads_prevail_desc:0 "With a clear agenda in mind, let us return to Parliament now more ready than we have ever been before."

ITA_assembly_in_addis_ababa:0 "Assembly in Addis Ababa"

ITA_albanian_referendum_desc:0 "One of the terms in the Treaty of London was that Albania would be a protectorate under our control. As the Great War did not end in our favour, we never saw this come to be, but now using our diplomatic power we could see through with this forgotten term."

ITA_investing_more_in_the_straits_desc:0 "The Straits Zone is an incredibly valuable place as it controls the Turkish Strait and consequently decides who can use the area for trade, and who can't. Funding more into the Straits Zone will give us a safe passage to trade through the region."
ITA_cairo_deal:0 "Cairo Deal"
ITA_cairo_deal_desc:0 "An economic deal between us and the Egyptians would grant us unlimited use of the Suez Canal."

# Events
ita.0.t:0 "The Italian Situation"
ita.0.d:0 "The Kingdom of Italy joined the Great War on the side of the Entente on May 23, 1915. Almost immediately, fighting began along Italy’s border with Austria, with the Italian army hoping to quickly bring the Austrians to their knees with a surprise offensive. Unsurprisingly, this failed, and soon the Alpine Front as it was known degraded into trench warfare, which would continue for the next 5 years. In 1920, with the European revolutions in full swing, the Treaty of Versailles was signed between the Entente and Central Powers restoring mainly the status quo. Italy, which had only been able to gain a slice of Turkey, Tunisia and an even smaller slice of Austria, entered a period of crisis known as the Red Biennium in 1921, where many expected the country to fall to civil war. This period would only end in 1923 with snap elections following Victor Emmanuel’s abdication, resulting in a victory for the Italian Socialist Party (PSI). Reforms were made, the king’s power was limited, and the country calmed down.\n\nBut all is far from stable in the kingdom, with the revolution in France and an economic crisis having polarized Italian politics to the point where many fear once more civil war would break out at any day. The current government’s inability to resolve Italy’s dire economic straits have caused a skyrocket in the popularity of radical parties, all of whom utilise the government’s weakness to bolster support for their own parties. Elections held in 1935 resulted in a narrow victory for the ruling PSU, which led to allegations of rigging and corruption on either side. The country’s opposition parties, long opposed to the socialists in Rome, are preparing to make a move. Italy’s future becomes more grim by the day."
ita.0.a:0 "Viva Italia!"

ita.1.t:0 "Compromise with Other Parties?"
ita.1.d:0 "The situation is currently dire as the government have failed to pass the Economic Relief Bill; which plans the economic recovery of Italy from the Great Depression. Many in the legislation have voted against it, and in order to pass it we need to cooperate with another party or faction. Which will it be?"
ita.1.a:0 "The Liberals"
ita.1.b:0 "The Socialists"

ita.2.t:0 "Economic Relief Bill failed to Pass!"
ita.2.d:0 "In something completely unanticipated, the Second Economic Relief bill has been shot dead in the Chamber of Deputies, in due to a coalition vote performed by the Lista Nationale, communist and conservative-moderate opposition. The government-led coalition on its own was not expected to provide a majority vote for the bill, but rather depended on independent and other progressive politicians, who now all seemingly decided to cross the floor and vote alongside the opposition. As a result, the bill was narrowly defeated by a fraction of a percent. Needless to say, the public reaction to the bill's failure is not, for a lack of a better term, optimal. Communists and nationalists alike rejoice, while large protests have already been reported in major cities, with thousands more disgruntled civilians joining them by the hour."
ita.2.a:0 "Democracy is a farce, anyways."

ita.3.t:0 "Riots in the Cities!"
ita.3.d:0 "Tensions were inevitably going to boil over at some point, so the question asked was 'when' instead of 'will'. The answer to that question was less than a week, exactly. Riots and fighting larger than that witnessed during the ill-fated March of Rome over a decade ago has gripped nearly every major city, from which thousands of casualties have been reported. With now even the coalition government paralysed in gridlock, their inaction has prompted many to call for the government's resignation, with even the most loyal voices in our party urging the government to hold snap elections. The fate of the country hangs in the balance."
ita.3.a:0 "Give me a break."

ita.4.t:0 "Resignation of the Prime Minister"
ita.4.d:0 "At 9 this morning, His Excellency the Prime Minister could not be found anywhere near his residence. Instead, he had spent the previous evening within the bounds of the royal residence, as keen eyes noted, but those keen eyes - nor minds, even - could not explain his reason for being there. That was, until midday today, twelve o’clock, where to the shock and horror and to the joy and cheers of those millions across the country, he announced his resignation, live on air in the rush of radio traffic, cutting through any other broadcast in the hour. Well over millions of our country’s citizens were estimated to have heard in complete clarity, which is a fine explanation for the tens of million jubilant citizens who flooded the streets in the few hours after. If these citizens had heard His Excellency’s speech in full - as long winded and unnecessarily over-complicated as it was - he did not say who he designated as his successor, the perfect arrangement for a power vacuum.\n\As the sun dipped below the horizon, the day came to a close, and someone else sat in the seat of the Prime Minister. It was:"
ita.4.a:0 "A clique of military officers, whom, paranoid of a socialist takeover, declared a military junta!"
ita.4.b:0 "His Majesty, the King himself, who intervened so as to protect Italy's democracy!"

ita.5.t:0 "The Military Takes Power"
ita.5.d:0 "Not even an hour after the infamous midday speech did numerous battalions of soldiers from the armed forces storm the government capitol, in an attempt to steal it from socialists who they thought were preparing to take it for themselves. The military administration has already made bold promises to fix the nation within a month, and crush ‘traitors wishing to sell the nation to the French’, possibly military jargon for democratically elected politicians. Quite paranoid, if you were to ask someone, but it seems this is the arrangement in control of Italy now."
ita.5.a:0 "Such is life."

ita.6.t:0 "The King's Intervention"
ita.6.d:0 "The very moment the former Prime Minister left the palace grounds was the moment the king ordered his motorcade for the government building, and he arrived there in time before anyone else. The role of Prime Minister, the name of whose occupant is now Victor Emmanuel III, no longer holds any power, as the king and his advisors control the country in a royal dictatorship. The king promises a swift return to democracy along with the removal of treasonous elements of the country within a month, but will these promises be filled, or may they just remain empty?"
