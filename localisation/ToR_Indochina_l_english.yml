The fate of several parties and, of course, the Federation itself could be decided today.\n\nIf the Social Democrats manage to secure enough votes, they will hold another term and will guide our country into the coming years. Another possibility would be the election of the reformers, that advocates for much more reforms in the Federation.\n\nWho shall win?"

 ich.3.t:0 "Protests!"
 ich.3.d:0 "As much to our suprise, protests have erupted in several metropolitan areas of our country.

Some officials recommends sending security forces to ensure order and that the country will not fall into chaos."

 ich.4.b:0 "The army have joined the coup"

 ich.5.t:0 "The Revolution is Defeated!"
 ich.5.d:0 "Our forces defeated the rebellion of the marxists and have occupied key locations in the capital. However, whispers within the Army's High Command suggests that they are talks between the military that this may be the chance to seize power for themselves and establish a dictatorship of their own."
 ich.5.a:0 "The Army restores the legitimate government to power"
 ich.5.b:0 "The Army establishes a Military Government"

 ich.6.t:0 "ICP Triumphant!"
 ich.6.d:0 "With most of the security forces have joined our cause against the corrupt capitalist government, we have successfully taken control of the capital and with that, the entire Federation."
