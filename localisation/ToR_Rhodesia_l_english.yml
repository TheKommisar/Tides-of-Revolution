#### ideas
RHO_breadbasket_of_africa:0 "Breadbasket of Africa"
RHO_breadbasket_of_africa_desc:0 "Our exports of wheat, tobacco and corn are renowned and have earned us the title of ‘Breadbasket of Africa’, as well as substantial amounts of cash for our fertile crops."

RHO_tribal_divisions:0 "Tribal Divisions"
RHO_tribal_divisions_desc:0 "The internal tribal divisions in our country, chiefly into the large Shona and Matabele tribes, mean that many potential recruits are lost to propaganda and misunderstandings. If we can create a truly multicultural army then we can change this image, and reap the rewards"

RHO_the_settler_state:0 "The settler state"
RHO_the_settler_state_desc:0 "Much like South Africa Rhodesia and Nyasaland has a large population of white settlers, many of whom immigrated to the colony to seek economic opportunities they never could get back home. This does give the government a large pool of skilled and educated workers as well as a more loyal local population to rely upon and service in its military. However like other British colonies it does not solve the issue of a vast majority population with little to no real power in the colony and the often hostile attitude of the settlers to increased rights does not help that. Nor does it solve the issue of manpower as few if any non whites can serve in the armed forces. The current balance of power towards the white settlers seems unlikley to last forever."

RHO_arthur_harris_pet_project:0 "Arthur Harris's pet project"
RHO_arthur_harris_pet_project_desc:0 "Ever since arriving in the colony to be its Governor Arthur Harris has persued the novel idea of building up the Royal Rhodesian Air Force rather than the army, arguing that air power will be the key to control of Africa should war or insurrection break out. To achieve this he is had poured funding into the Air Force and aquired numerous aircraft retired from British service. His plan is controversial but it could bear fruit in time."
