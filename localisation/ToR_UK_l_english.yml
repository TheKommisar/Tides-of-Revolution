#Ideas
ENG_the_rearmament_crisis:0 "The Rearnament Crisis"
ENG_the_rearmament_crisis_desc:0 "The landslide victory for the Liberals saw some of the largest defence cuts in British History and the army reduced to a tiny size. During the late 1920s and early 1930s few cared about national defence, trusting the Liberals diplomatic plans to work against a future war. Germanys increasingly militarist position however would wake a nation to the reality of things, war once again seemed likley.\n\nHowever the Liberals attempts to begin the long path of rearnament have found themselves stalled in the House of Commons by Militarist Tory and Pacifistic Labour MP's. In late 1935 this culminated in several defections from the Liberals and the collapse of there government with elections scheduled for late February. With Militarist paramilitaries brawling on the streets with peace marchers and rumours of a military plot in the works something must be done to solve the crisis at hand!"

ENG_legacy_of_the_great_war:0 "Legacy of the Great War"
ENG_legacy_of_the_great_war_desc:0 "The Great War scarred the British People greatly, a generation had been lost and for so little in return, only made worse by the 1920s economic slump and the Tories policy of peacetime conscription. Though the nation has recovered to some degree the war has deeply scared the British national psyche and it will take much to get them to be willing to fight once more...if ever."

ENG_sluggish_economy:0 "Sluggish Economy"
ENG_sluggish_economy_desc:0 "Britain in the early 1920s was plunged into economic ruin due to massive war debts to America, a fall in global trade and successive stock market shocks. Despite a massive attempt by the Liberals to restore prosperity this has had a limited effect and Britain is still burdened with a weak and uncompetitive economy."

ENG_Decentralised_Empire:0 "Decentralised Empire"
ENG_Decentralised_Empire_desc:0 "The 1918 Imperial Conference led to the largest series of changes to Imperial governance in recent memory as the dominions were given full self governance, India was granted home rule and the colonies were given increased local control over there affairs (though still with appointed govenors). This has led to a period of surprising stability throughout the Empire and for London the costs of maintaining it are far less. There are issues however as the Empire now lacks a clear centre of authority or clear goals in mind, furthermore several colonial govenors have entrenched themselves in there colonies and openly defying orders from London, but these issues will surely pass right?"

ENG_low_naval_investments:0 "Low Naval Investments"
ENG_low_naval_investments_desc:0 "In an attempt to save money the Liberal government has since 1924 kept naval building and funding to a minimum with no capital ships having been built since then. This policy does save the treasury a great deal of money it has lead to our fleet becoming heavily run down and increasingly outdated in the face of renewed threats. Work has begun to change this but it will take time."

ENG_paramilitary_violence:0 "Paramilitary violence"
ENG_paramilitary_violence_desc:0 "First appearing as private defence forces promoted by the Tories following the fall of France to Communism paramilitary groups have spread rapidly across the country soon becoming active political forces in the country much to the chagrin of the political establishment.\n\nCurrently the paramilitaries are split between two main factions, the left leaning Intenational League supported by the Communist Party of Great Britain and the Imperial Leagues supported by sections of the Military. There are also several minor groups including the Social Credit sponsored Greenshirts.\n\nAs the paramilitaries continue to grow in power calls are becoming louder and louder for something to be done about these groups which menance the British people!"

ENG_The_two_forces_1:0 "The two forces"
ENG_The_two_forces_1_desc:0 "With the passing of the Liberals rearnament bill the army is now effectively split into two forces, the professional army and the reserve force. This has created chaos in our armed forces over how this duel system is to work and the chain of command. Something that may take a while to resolve."

ENG_The_two_forces_2:0 "The two forces"
ENG_The_two_forces_2_desc:0 "Thanks to our efforts the two different forces of the British army are now working well together and we no longer have to fear chaos within our ranks once war breaks out."

ENG_low_naval_investments_3:0 "High naval investments"
ENG_low_naval_investments_3_desc:0 "Like during the dreadnought race money is being poured into the Royal Navy for the construction of ships at an almost alarming rate but allowing for vast numbers of new ships to be built."

ENG_lessons_of_Jutland:0 "Lessons of Jutland"
ENG_lessons_of_Jutland_desc:0 "The Battle of Jutland demonstrated many failings of the Royal Navy and hard lessons that needed to be learned. These lessons must be learnt and improved upon so that even if it may delay construction and deployment of new capital ships, they may be the best in the world!"

#Descriptions
POLITICS_GEORGE_V_DESC:0 "WIP \n\nGeorge V (his full name being George Frederick Ernest Albert) was not supposed to be King, being the second son of Edward VII, and was originally destined to serve in the navy until the death of his brother Albert Victor in 1892. Following his death he became Duke of York, and after the death of his Grandmother Queen Victoria, he became Prince of Wales. For the man destined to be King-Emperor he lived a quiet life in the rather unimpressive York Cottage, a marked contrast to his extravagant father Edward VII.\n\nAfter the death of his father, he would ascend to the throne and has throughout his reign faced crisis after crisis. From the People's budget and the Home Rule Crisis to the Great War and the ensuing economic and social decline afterwards, he has had much to face as monarch and has for the most part been able to shoulder its burdens, often acting as a voice of moderation for many governments. The stress of his reign, though, has taken a serious toll on his health, and by 1936 death is not far away for him.\n\nThough by no means an intellectual or particularly interesting (his only two real pastimes being hunting and stamp collecting) he is a beloved figure amongst the British people and is seen as a dedicated and upstanding monarch, relatable to his people. This is especially when compared to his controversial son the Prince of Wales, a man who George has, to put it mildly, low expectations of."

uk.1.t:0 "The King is dead, God Save the King!"
uk.1.d:0 "The King is dead. In an event many have feared, King George V has passed away, although to the relief of many, quite peacefully. Currently at this hour is established the fact of the time of his death, 12:15AM, with members of his family, his doctors and close friends beside him. Though we not yet know the circumstances of this tragedy, it is certain that his severe health problems and depression played a major role in His Majesty’s passing.\n\nHis Majesty reigned for two-and-a-half decades, overseeing the empire through the fruitless Great War and working day and night to avert the total collapse of the empire, which caused his severe depression and stress problems leading to his death. To make matters worse, during His Majesty’s reign, the Great Economic Crash of 1928 and ensuing economic depression nearly crippled the economy and led to its unstable state which it is in now.\n\nThe procedures for succession will be enacted effective immediately, whilst the populace still mourns. George V’s eldest son, Edward, Prince of Wales, shall inherit the crown and assume the title of Edward VIII, yet many believe his unorthodox way of life and independence of thought disqualifies him from bearing such an honourable title. The government under Sir Herbert Samuel are preparing to make sure he will accept direction from the future Prime Minister and the Cabinet."
uk.1.a:0 "God Save The King."

uk.2.t:0 "Britannia's Situation"
uk.2.d:0 "Though victorious in the Great War the British Empire suffered terribly from it. Its strength and standing were severely damaged from the conflict and the nation fell heavily in debt to America and other foreign powers. And even as the peace was signed all Britain had fought for began to fall apart as France fell into civil war and an arab revolt forced a humiliating withdrawal from much of the Middle East. The Liberal coalition fell apart in early 1919 and the Conservatives took control after a snap election. Soon after due to a scandal regarding many high ranking Labour party leaders after a purported (and fabricated) plot was uncovered to overthrow the government. This caused it to greatly decrease in popularity and many of its MP’s would join the Liberals who would return to power in a landslide victory in 1924. They would pass numerous radical measures to try and revive the economy, ended many unpopular Conservative measures and drastically cut military spending. Those cuts in spending however would come back to haunt them as Britain was caught woefully off guard by the German coup and soon became embroiled in a political crisis over how to rearm the nation, something many hope this year's elections will finally solve.\n\nHowever just before the Liberals fell from power they would oversee the 1918 Imperial Conference which would drastically change the balance of power in the Empire. India was granted Dominion status and the other Dominions granted effective independence from Britain, the notable exception to this decentralisation of power was Ireland which after a bloody rebellion in 1918 over conscription was only given limited dominion status much to the anger of its people. Though these changes have appeased many people in the Empire it has also made it disunited and there is increasing uncertainty of whether the Empire will in difficult times stick together.\n\nDespite many problems though the British Empire still stands as the largest in world history, with the largest fleet in the world and the potential to return to its past splendour...if all goes well.(WIP)"
