#Ideas
ENG_Legacy_of_the_Great_War:0 "The War to end all Wars"
ENG_Legacy_of_the_Great_War_desc:0 "Though Britain may have emerged victorious in the Great War it was at an immense cost and for almost nothing in return, a generation lost and the once invincible Empire shackled to crippling debt and the national psyche deeply scarred. The resulting impact has made the British people unwilling to intervene on the world stage or to persue a policy of rearnament, crippling the ability for the government to rebuild the woefully understrength army."

ENG_sluggish_economy:0 "Sluggish Economy"
ENG_sluggish_economy_desc:0 "Britain in the early 1920s was plunged into economic ruin due to massive war debts to America, a fall in global trade and successive stock market shocks. Despite a massive attempt by the Liberals to restore prosperity this has had a limited effect and Britain is still burdened with a weak and uncompetitive economy."

ENG_Decentralised_Empire:0 "Decentralised Empire"
ENG_Decentralised_Empire_desc:0 "The 1918 Imperial Conference led to the largest series of changes to Imperial governance in recent memory as the dominions were given full self governance, India was granted home rule and the colonies were given increased local control over there affairs (though still with appointed govenors). This has led to a period of surprising stability throughout the Empire and for London the costs of maintaining it are far less. There are issues however as the Empire now lacks a clear centre of authority or clear goals in mind, furthermore several colonial govenors have entrenched themselves in there colonies and openly defying orders from London, but these issues will surely pass right?"

ENG_the_grand_fleet:0 "The Grand Fleet"
ENG_the_grand_fleet_desc:0 "Though prehaps not as dominant as it once was the Royal Navy still stands as the largest and most formidable fleet on the planet boasting a vast number of capital ships. Though costly to the treasury its benefits to defence of both the British Isles and the Empire are seen by manny to greatly outway it. Furthermore the experiance from maintaining such a massive fleet has given Britain an advantage in shipbuilding and naval warfare."

ENG_disorganised_defence:0 "Disorganised Militias"
ENG_disorganised_defence_desc:0 "Following the abolition of conscription the British Army adopted a system of local part time militias in order to bolster the tiny professional army intended to be called up in the event of a major war. However there implementation was poorly done by the apethetic liberal government and lacked the support of the people. As a result instead of the national system of defence intended there are scattered units across the country who often hugely vary in quality, many are under the control of extremist groups such as the Imperial Leagues and the Greenshirts. This is not to mention the crippling effect it has on the regualr armies manpower pool. Something must be done!"

ENG_the_officers_plot:0 "The Officers Plot"
ENG_the_officers_plot_desc:0 "Whilst many in high society think that the greatest threat Britain faces is across the channel from Communist France they are mistaken. Rather it is a cabal of disgruntled officers from across the British Army, dissatisifed at the way the Liberals have run the country and inspired by the coup in Germany. Though there existance is an open secret across British society there size, strength and true intentions are still unknown though it is feared that the people will know shortly."

uk.1.t:0 "The King is dead, God Save the King!"
uk.1.d:0 " The King is dead. In an event many have feared, King George V has passed away, although to the relief of many, quite peacefully. Currently at this hour is established the fact of the time of his death, 12:15AM, with members of his family, his doctors and close friends beside him. Though we not yet know the circumstances of this tragedy, it is for sure that his severe health problems and depression played a major role in His Majesty’s passing.\n\nHis Majesty reigned for two-and-a-half decades, overseeing the empire through the fruitless Great War and working day and night to avert the total collapse of the empire, which caused his severe depression and stress problems leading to his death. To make matters worse, during His Majesty’s reign, the Great Economic Crash of 1929 and ensuing economic depression nearly crippled the economy and led to its unstable state which it is in now.\n\nThe procedures for succession will be enacted effective immediately, whilst the populace still mourns. George V’s eldest son, Edward, Prince of Wales, shall inherit the crown and assume the title of Edward VIII, yet many believe his unorthodox way of life and independence of thought disqualifies him from bearing such an honourable title. The government under Sir Herbert Samuel are preparing to make sure he will accept direction from the future Prime Minister and the Cabinet."
uk.1.a:0 "God Save The King."

uk.2.t:0 "Britannia's Situation"
uk.2.d:0 "Though victorious in the Great War the British Empire suffered terribly from it. Its strength and standing were severely damaged from the conflict and the nation fell heavily in debt to America and other foreign powers. The Liberal coalition fell apart in early 1919 and the Conservatives took control after a snap election. Soon after due to a scandal regarding many high ranking Labour party leaders after a purported (and fabricated) plot was uncovered to overthrow the government. This caused it to greatly decrease in popularity, and many of its MP’s would join the Liberals.\n\nBut even as peace was signed all that Britain had fought for would begin to crumble as France fell to the red tide and Britain would be forced to withdraw from much of the Middle East after a humiliating defeat to Arab tribesmen. Though a rebellion in Ireland in 1918 would be crushed, home rule would be granted in 1924 and the dominions would be given full autonomy in their own affairs. The Empire teeters on the edge as India is embroiled in near constant unrest and anti-imperialist movements across the Empire grow in strength. (WIP)"

#Descriptions
POLITICS_GEORGE_V_DESC:0 "WIP \n\nGeorge was not supposed to be King and was originally destined to serve in the navy until the death of his brother Albert Victor in 1892. Following his death he became Duke of York and after the death of his Grandmother Queen Victoria he became Prince of Wales. Despite his newfound position though he lived a quite life in the rather unimpressive York Cottege, a marked contrast to his father King Edward Vii.\n\n In 1910 following the death of his father Edward Vii he became King. His reign has seen the British Empire face its greatest trials, Irish Nationalism, the rise of socialism and far right movements and of course the Great War and its aftermath. These have all put a great strain on the King, his health having declined significantly through the 1920s and early 1930s, he is not expected to live for much longer."
