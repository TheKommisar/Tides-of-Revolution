uk.1.t:0 "Death Of The King"
uk.1.d:0 " The King is dead. In an event many have feared, By the Grace of God, of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas King, Defender of the Faith, Saviour of the Empire, Emperor of India King George Frederick Ernest Albert V has passed away, although to the relief of many, quite peacefully. Currently at this hour is established the fact of the time of his death, 12:15AM, with members of his family, his doctors and close friends beside him. Though we not yet know the circumstances of this tragedy, it is for sure that his severe health problems and depression played a major role in His Majesty’s passing.\n\nHis Majesty reigned for two-and-a-half decades, overseeing the empire through the fruitless Great War and working day and night to avert the total collapse of the empire, which caused the severe depression and stress problems leading to his death. To make matters worse, during His Majesty’s reign, the Great Economic Crash of 1929 and ensuing Great Depression nearly crippled the economy and led to its unstable state which it is in now.\n\nThe procedures for succession will be enacted effective immediately, whilst the populace still mourns. George V’s eldest son, Edward, Prince of Wales, shall inherit the crown and assume the title of Edward VIII, yet many believe his unorthodox way of life and independence of thought disqualifies him from bearing such an honourable title. The government under Sir Herbert Samuel are preparing to make sure he will accept direction from the Prime Minister and the Cabinet."

uk.1000.t:0 "Remembrance Day"
uk.1000.d:0 "The streets of London, and other cities across the isle for that matter were quiet, quiet for today was Remembrance Day. This day, November 11 is the anniversary of the end of the Great War, the cessation of fighting on the Western front, from Ypres to Belfort, where man saw the best and the worst of himself, where friendships formed from mud and blood and were lost in craters and trenches as quickly as they had come.\n\n[ENG.GetLeader] emerged from his vehicle, greeted to a regiment of Royal Guardsmen lined in formation, their red uniforms, tall hats and stern expression able to put the strongest-willed man at unease. Directly behind them a large crowd of civvies had gathered for the annual procession. In front of [ENG.GetLeader] was The Cenotaph, the memorial of the fallen.\n\nCannon fire rang through the city as [ENG.GetLeader] laid the wreath upon the stone of the monument. During the two-minute-silence in honour of the fallen, deep in his heart, he thought most dearly and truly he hoped he would not bear witness to another Great War, to any more suffering or death or destruction, to any more orphaned children or dead young men. But this thought was suddenly shot out of his mind with a bugle man's rendition of the last post. The yearly memorial service had come to an end.\n\n‘They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old;\nAge shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.\nAt the going down of the sun and in the morning\nWe will remember them.’\n\nLest we Forget."
