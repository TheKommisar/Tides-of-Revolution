uk.1.t:0 "The King is dead, God Save the King!"
uk.1.d:0 " The King is dead. In an event many have feared, King George V has passed away, although to the relief of many, quite peacefully. Currently at this hour is established the fact of the time of his death, 12:15AM, with members of his family, his doctors and close friends beside him. Though we not yet know the circumstances of this tragedy, it is for sure that his severe health problems and depression played a major role in His Majesty’s passing.\n\nHis Majesty reigned for two-and-a-half decades, overseeing the empire through the fruitless Great War and working day and night to avert the total collapse of the empire, which caused his severe depression and stress problems leading to his death. To make matters worse, during His Majesty’s reign, the Great Economic Crash of 1929 and ensuing economic depression nearly crippled the economy and led to its unstable state which it is in now.\n\nThe procedures for succession will be enacted effective immediately, whilst the populace still mourns. George V’s eldest son, Edward, Prince of Wales, shall inherit the crown and assume the title of Edward VIII, yet many believe his unorthodox way of life and independence of thought disqualifies him from bearing such an honourable title. The government under Sir Herbert Samuel are preparing to make sure he will accept direction from the future Prime Minister and the Cabinet."
uk.1.a:0 "God Save The King."

uk.2.t:0 "Britannia's Situation"
uk.2.d:0 "Though victorious in the Great War the British Empire suffered terribly from it. Its strength and standing were severely damaged from the conflict and the nation fell heavily in debt to America and other foreign powers. The Liberal coalition fell apart in early 1919 and the Conservatives took control after a snap election. Soon after due to a scandal regarding many high ranking Labour party leaders after a purported (and fabricated) plot was uncovered to overthrow the government. This caused it to greatly decrease in popularity, and many of its MP’s would join the Liberals.\n\nBut even as peace was signed all that Britain had fought for would begin to crumble as France fell to the red tide and Britain would be forced to withdraw from much of the Middle East after a humiliating defeat to Arab tribesmen. Though a rebellion in Ireland in 1918 would be crushed, home rule would be granted in 1924 and the dominions would be given full autonomy in their own affairs. The Empire teeters on the edge as India is embroiled in near constant unrest and anti-imperialist movements across the Empire grow in strength. (WIP)"
