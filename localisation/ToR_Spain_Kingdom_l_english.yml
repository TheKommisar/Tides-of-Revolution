#Descriptions

POLITICS_ALFONSO_XIII_DESC:0 "Born on May 17 1886, Alfonso XIII of Spain is not one known to have luck on his side, with his childhood mired with disasters, deaths and countless tragedies inflicted upon his family and the Kingdom of Spain. He is the second King of Spain since the short-lived Republic of 1873 which deposed the monarchy, before it was restored not more than a year after its abolishment. The first son of Alfonso XII, his wait as heir to the throne was set to be a long one, yet in a stroke of misfortune his father passed away just shy of his 28th birthday, placing him as the new king, although not yet born. Dysentery they said, or it could have been tuberculosis. But none of that matters now.\n\nHis mother would serve as regent of Spain until his 16th birthday. During that time, Spain lost some of its most valuable colonial possessions as a result of the Spanish-American War, and from there on Spain’s status on the world stage dwindled as problems once miniscule began to plague the country. After the Great War, Spain under his reign did stabilise somewhat, but was hit by the ever-so-aptly named Spanish Flu of 1918, yet this was balanced out with a quick and decisive war in the Rif ordered by Alfonso himself, which settled the Spanish colonial debate and gave Spain the boost of confidence it needed in these trying times.\n\nAlfonso is not a man you have a neutral opinion of; you either love him, or hate him. One side of the populace regard him as the saviour of Spain, a figurehead of determination, to push through in the most desperate of times, yet the other view him as nothing but a spineless coward; the worst monarch in Spain’s unstable history. Yet whatever opinion you have of this man, you can’t not admit he is one of their boldest monarchs in history, although such boldness could make or break Spain’s status from here."

#Ideas
SPA_crisis_in_the_government:0 "Crisis in the Cabinet"
SPA_crisis_in_the_government_desc:0 "The cabinet is fractured and the government is not working as intended."
SPA_strong_military:0 "The Bull that Braves"
SPA_strong_military_desc:0 "The Spanish Army is the main land army of the Kingdom of Spain. Founded sometime in the 15th century, it has existed continuously since the reign of King Ferdinand II of Aragon. It is one of the oldest and strongest land armies on earth, and has played a major role in keeping stability in the Kingdom.\n\nVeteran and War Hero General Francisco Franco leads the force as its Chief of Staff, with his prior experience coming from the wars in the Rif and Morocco, the latter of which he oversaw to victory. Franco’s most famous victory was at the Battle of Khenifra in 1924, where an encircled and outmanned Spanish expeditionary force led by Franco was able to annihilate the much larger Berber force, crippling their fighting capabilities and eventually forcing them to sue for peace.\n\n§RHowever, this can backfire at us§"
SPA_national_unrest:0 "National Unrest"
