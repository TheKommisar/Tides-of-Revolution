australia.1.t:0 "Australia's Situation"
australia.1.d:0 "Australia's entry into the Great War took place a day after the British declaration of war upon the German Empire, over the invasion of Belgium. Troops from the young Commonwealth saw action first at the strait of Gallipoli alongside New Zealanders and other soldiers of the Entente. Although the campaign was a devastating military defeat, the unbreakable chain of 'mateship' had already been forged in the blood-soaked waters of Anzac Cove. Australia's contribution continued in the Western Front with the Battles of Fromelles and Pozieres, and finally with the Grand Offensive of 1919. At the end of the war, opinion towards returning veterans was mixed. They had fought in a war, for what? Only the British had managed to gain anything of value - what Australia gained were coffins and war debts, and the usual reminder to 'serve the empire'. It was as a result of the futility of the war, lobbying efforts towards the passing of a statute of autonomy began. Australia seeked to form her own destiny, free of British overlordship, and this happened in 1931. Crowds rejoiced with the passing of the Statute of Westminster, and as a result nominal independence and self-government. Yet the Labor cabinets of the post-independence Australia quickly split apart with the onset of the Great Depression, which affected all countries reliant on the United States for their trade. In the elections of 1928, the newly formed United Australia Party dominated the polls and led the country into a post-depression recovery and has begun to slowly re-arm against the Russian, French and German threats posing against Britannia and her allies."
