australia.1.t:0 "Farmers Agitated by Emus"
australia.1.d:0 "A letter arrived from the Governor of Western Australia today regarding the emu threat persisting throughout the countryside. His letter, in short, described the current situation Australian farmers have had currently battling the emu threat \n\nConsidering how we lost the First Emu War, the government is split 50/50 on whether to intervene militarily. Some argue leaving the farmers to deal with the birds is the better choice, while others say that having learnt from misakes of the first war, we can avoid them, and win against the emus. A third option involves placing a bounty out for the birds, and although it may not be as effective as intervening it could certainly save us embarassment. The latter option will cull the emu threat faster, but we risk wasting resources should we fail."
