### Name and Description ###
BM_HISTORY_TITLE:0 "Brief History"

TIDES_OF_REVOLUTION_NAME:0 "Tides of Revolution"

FUHRERREICH_DESC:0 "The end of the Great War saw the empires of the old—the Ottomans, the Austrians, and the Germans—fall greatly in both power and influence while the United States, Britain, and France have risen. While the Great War was thought by many to usher in a new era of peace, it seems that the tensions of old have not yet faded away and, with them, could threaten the tenuous peace that remains..."

###OTHER COUNTRIES DESC###
OTHER_TIDES_OF_REVOLUTION_DESC:0 "It is 1936, and the world is on a brink of a new, inevitable, war. But the world is made up of more than a few monolithic empires. The smallest stones can bring about tidal waves, and these lesser states can bring about much change. Will you side with the nationalists? Will you carry on the torch of the revolution? Or maybe you will grant your people true freedom, the likes of which they have never seen? The world will soon derail from its current situation, plummeting into the hells of war. And it will not wait for your decisions."

#POLITICS_JFC_FULLER_DESC:0 "J.F.C. Fuller is the military dictator and leader of the former United Kingdom. With the death of the duumvirate of Haig and Kitchener, Fuller was the military's successful candidate to succeed to the position of dictator. However, he has brought with him his fascination for the occult and belief in Anglo-Saxon revival, which has caused some to regret their choice. Fuller is an erratic and cruel dictator, crushing dissent and seeking to aggressively expand his state in order to solidify control and restore England to her former glory."

POLITICS_TOM_MANN_DESC:0 "A veteran trade unionist, Tom Mann has had a long career in socialist agitation and longs to see international revolution. First, however, he must start at home."

POLITICS_OSWALD_MOSLEY_DESC:0 "Oswald Mosley saw the defeat of the British Empire in the Guerra Mondiale from the front lines. He then watched in horror as Britain collapsed in on herself and the military seized power, destroying centuries of parliamentary traditions and usurping rightful authority. He spurned Folkloric Ednewing and the Anglo-Saxon revival as nonsensical backward thinking, arguing instead from the underground political scene that Britain needed a "new machine" to fulfil her political goals. Now, Mosley is able to restore Britain's glory himself, though whether or not he permits royal power to return remains in question."

#POLITICS_EDWARD_VIII_DESC:0 "With the death of George V at the end of 1935, Edward VIII became the de jure King-Emperor of the United Kingdom and her Empire overseas. However, it took for the removal of the lickspittle maniac J.F.C. Fuller for Edward to assume his full power within the United Kingdom itself. Now the King must turn to the errant parts of his Dominions and reassert British rule. Edward VIII himself is not an absolute dictator, but politics have not reverted to a pre-military coup state.."

POLITICS_PAUL_REYNAUD_DESC:0 "Paul Reynaud made his first major appearance in French politics in 1919, Reynaud was elected as part of the Conservative 'Blue Horizon' Bloc. Quickly developing a reputation for being a Savvy politician, Reynaud soon clarified his allegiance as a member of the Fédération Républicaine. Quickly climbing ranks within the party due to his Militant nature in foreign policy, Reynaud rose to the position of the Vice-President of the FR. In 1925, Auguste Isaac resigned his position as President of the Fédération Républicaine and sought to appoint a Militant successor in order to strengthen the platform of the party. Reynaud was a natural candidate due to his popularity within the party and firm stance on foreign affiars. Under Reynaud's leadership, the Fédération Républicaine managed gathering the most votes and seats in both the 1928 & 1932 Elections. An extremely pragmatic man, Reynaud follows one doctrine in foreign policy; France has no Friends, only Interests."
